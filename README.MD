# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.

## 📌 Features
- Uses scikit-learn's KMeans for clustering
- Applies the Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters
- Visualizes customer groups using Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset
Sample data includes:
- CustomerID
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells
3. View the plotted customer clusters

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📈 Output
The model creates customer groups such as:
- High income, low spending
- Low income, high spending
- High income, high spending (valuable)
